# MobyDump

Downloads data from MobyGames and outputs it in a delimiter-separated value file or JSON.

## Before you begin

You must set the `MOBY_API` environment variable to your MobyGames API key for MobyDump
to work. To do so:

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the same folder MobyDump is in.

1.  Add your MobyGames API key as follows, replacing `<MOBYGAMES_API_KEY>` with your
    API key:

    ```none
    MOBY_API="<MOBYGAMES_API_KEY>"
    ```
