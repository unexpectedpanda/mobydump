Armor Battle	Atari 2600 Title: Armor Ambush	<p>Armor Ambush (aka <em>Armor Battle</em>) is a two player game, where each player is in command of two tanks (one at a time), and they must try to destroy each other.</p> <p>The battlefields constantly change, so no battle is ever the same. Tanks move at average speed on grass, fast on roads, slow through trees, and slowest through water.</p> <p>Tanks will explode after three direct hits. The Harder game mode adds ricochet shots.</p>	8883	Basic Genres: Action, Basic Genres: Racing / Driving, Perspective: Diagonal-down, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Tank	5.8	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8883/armor-battle/	23		Windows (2010-03-24), Atari 2600 (1982-09), Intellivision (1979), Xbox 360 (2010-03-24)	[{'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1803783-armor-battle-intellivision-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6383d0e4-ab78-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Just blew up a tank', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1803999-armor-battle-intellivision-just-blew-up-a-tank.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/64203d3a-ab78-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1803571-armor-battle-intellivision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/62f83e8a-ab78-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The scoreboard', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1803440-armor-battle-atari-2600-the-scoreboard.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/62a29340-ab78-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The blue tank going in for the kill...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1803316-armor-battle-atari-2600-the-blue-tank-going-in-for-the-kill.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6250fc10-ab78-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4096801-armor-battle-intellivision-front-cover.jpg	['Intellivision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/b36e7190-aba5-11ed-bc1c-02420a00019a.webp	564
Asteroids	Brazilian Polyvox release: Asteroids (Asteróides), Turkish title: Meteorlar Geliyor	<p>Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.</p> <p>The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) in any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship's direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid a collision. The warp, however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.</p> <p>Asteroids when shot will break up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot will break up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. </p> <p>Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.</p> <p><strong>Game Difficulty and Variations</strong>  </p> <p>There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. </p> <p>The game also offers three different game variations:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Standard Play</strong> - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Competition Asteroids</strong> - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Team Asteroids</strong> - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Scoring</strong>  </p> <p>The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.</p> <ul> <li>Small saucer - 1,000 points</li> <li>Other player's ship - 500 points</li> <li>Large saucer - 200 points</li> <li>Small asteroid - 100 points</li> <li>Medium asteroid - 50 points</li> <li>Large asteroid - 20 points</li> </ul>	8872	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	7.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8872/asteroids/	124		Windows (2010-05-19), Game Boy (1992-02), Atari 2600 (1981), Atari 7800 (1987), Atari 8-bit (1981), Xbox 360 (2010-05-19), Arcade (1979-11), Antstream (2020-05-05)	[{'caption': 'Game starts', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16421042-asteroids-arcade-game-starts.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/2f7a9710-c216-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3410510-asteroids-atari-8-bit-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/bae94d76-ab8e-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1841815-asteroids-atari-7800-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/bd621d50-ab78-11ed-8bb9-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Watch out for that flying saucer!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1842214-asteroids-atari-7800-watch-out-for-that-flying-saucer.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/be453b76-ab78-11ed-8bb9-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': '1 coin 1 play', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16424060-asteroids-arcade-1-coin-1-play.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/16eb6052-c217-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 640}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3915758-asteroids-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/70412fee-ab9f-11ed-8d2b-02420a00019e.webp	582

Battlezone		<p>Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS), <em>Battlezone</em> is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</p>	360	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: 1st-person, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Tank, Vehicular Themes: Vehicular combat, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	6.9	https://www.mobygames.com/game/360/battlezone/	79		Windows (2010-05-12), PC Booter (1983), Atari ST (1986), Commodore 64 (1984-06), Atari 2600 (1983-08), Apple II (1984-04), Atari 8-bit (1988-01), ZX Spectrum (1984-09), VIC-20 (1984-04), Xbox 360 (2010-05-12), Arcade (1980-11), Antstream (2020-03-17)	[{'caption': 'Got the saucer!', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16791571-battlezone-arcade-got-the-saucer.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d64297ca-c381-11ed-9226-02420a000121.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2012956-battlezone-atari-st-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5eef2c48-ab7a-11ed-8ed2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Some tanks in sight', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2010140-battlezone-atari-2600-some-tanks-in-sight.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/586b9b04-ab7a-11ed-ba50-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Enemy in range...', 'height': 265, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2011404-battlezone-vic-20-enemy-in-range.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5b506656-ab7a-11ed-8e21-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 384}, {'caption': 'Taking shots at the enemy.', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/5135863-battlezone-pc-booter-taking-shots-at-the-enemy.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f4d75ba4-abcf-11ed-b721-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/5232941-battlezone-pc-booter-front-cover.jpg	['PC Booter']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/6c75d74e-abd5-11ed-9377-02420a000197.webp	586
Beamrider	alternate box title: Dave Rolfe's Beamrider	<p><em>Beamrider</em> is a 3D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</p>	8929	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Behind view, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	6.9	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8929/beamrider/	42		Windows (2010-08-04), Commodore 64 (1984-06), Atari 2600 (1984-03), ColecoVision (1984-05), Intellivision (1983-09), Atari 5200 (1984-10), Atari 8-bit (1984-08), ZX Spectrum (1984-10), MSX (1984-09), Xbox 360 (2010-08-04)	[{'caption': 'The end of level sentinel', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/91363-beamrider-atari-5200-the-end-of-level-sentinel.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/95d95bfe-ab69-11ed-80c1-02420a000196.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/413604-beamrider-colecovision-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e69d74d2-ab6c-11ed-b6ec-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'In the space station between levels', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/375217-beamrider-commodore-64-in-the-space-station-between-levels.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/99b40f64-ab6c-11ed-9505-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Ready to begin the next level', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/411831-beamrider-colecovision-ready-to-begin-the-next-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e325b79c-ab6c-11ed-9d05-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/383714-beamrider-commodore-64-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/aad2f6de-ab6c-11ed-a061-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3921234-beamrider-intellivision-front-cover.jpg	['Intellivision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/a0c915aa-ab9f-11ed-aecf-02420a000198.webp	572
Berzerk		<p>You have been sent into a building infested with robots, and must do your best to clear it out. Each room has a number of walls through the middle, which restricts your movement. There will be a number of bad guys in the room - on early screens they may be immobile and not shoot at you, but after a few levels, they become capable of shooting in multiple directions. You can shoot at them in 8 directions, but can't shoot diagonally while moving. There are gaps at the side of each room, through which you exit, before or after clearing the room (there is a bonus for clearance). You get an extra life every 2000 points.</p>	8847	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	7.4	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8847/berzerk/	66		Atari 2600 (1982), Atari 5200 (1984-02), Vectrex (1982), Arcade (1980), Antstream (2024-04-30)	"[{'caption': ""Don't touch the walls."", 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16360122-berzerk-arcade-dont-touch-the-walls.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/fc52ca22-c203-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Here comes Evil Otto...', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/203166-berzerk-atari-5200-here-comes-evil-otto.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/31fe58da-ab6b-11ed-bc1c-02420a00019a.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Keep blasting.', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16360233-berzerk-arcade-keep-blasting.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/036a035c-c204-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': ""There's a lot of robots here..."", 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15639495-berzerk-vectrex-theres-a-lot-of-robots-here.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1a68af2e-bded-11ed-b791-02420a0001bb.webp', 'width': 360}, {'caption': 'A High Score.', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16360188-berzerk-arcade-a-high-score.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/00ad8012-c204-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}]"	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4182448-berzerk-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/c7f38f94-aba8-11ed-8b70-02420a00019a.webp	590

Breakout	Sears Tele-Games release: Breakaway IV, Video Games GmbH German release: Crash, Universal Japanese standing cabinet release: Scratch!, Taito Japanese release (cabinet): Super Block, Windows tag-lined title: Super Breakout: Classic Play/All New Way!, Taito Japanese release (cocktail table): T.T. Block, Universal Japanese cocktail cabinet release: Table Scratch	<p>In <em>Breakout</em>, there is a wall of bricks along the top of the screen and your goal is to destroy the entire wall one brick at a time! To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit). Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</p>	9001	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Paddle / Pong, Interface/Control: Direct control	6.4	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9001/breakout/	48		Windows (2010-10-27), Atari 2600 (1978), Xbox 360 (2010-10-27), Arcade (1976-04), Antstream (2022-05-31), Atari VCS (2022-03-18)	[{'caption': 'Use the paddle to break the blocks with the ball.', 'height': 419, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16431056-breakout-arcade-use-the-paddle-to-break-the-blocks-with-the-ball.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f9c0a5e4-c218-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 289}, {'caption': 'Smashing through bricks...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1285849-breakout-atari-2600-smashing-through-bricks.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d91d4e98-ab73-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Starting.', 'height': 419, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16407503-breakout-arcade-starting.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/039aa3f0-c212-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 289}, {'caption': 'Just started a new game', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1285752-breakout-atari-2600-just-started-a-new-game.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d8e976ea-ab73-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Game demo mode', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1285626-breakout-atari-2600-game-demo-mode.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d8aef3c6-ab73-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3925183-breakout-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/c386fdaa-ab9f-11ed-9505-02420a00019c.webp	582
Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom	Unlicenced Arcade Title: Zoom 909, Japanese SG-1000 title: Zoom 909	<p><em>Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom</em> is a single player science fiction themed obstacle race, where the player controls Buck Rogers' space ship and must guide it through multiple pairs of pylons throughout the game. Controlling the ship involves side scrolling to the left or right, stop, moving forward (and faster), and moving backwards/break (and slower). Additionally, the spaceship can also fire its weapon to unleash a pair of energy bolts.</p> <p>The player starts in sector 1.0 and will finish this level after the player successfully goes between an allocated number of pylons, indicated at the top left side of the screen; the first requirement is 9 pylons and will gradually increase with each new sector. In sector 1.1., with the addition of having to complete the pylon requirement, a group of flying saucers, ranging from 1 to 4 (per group), fly in a pattern. The player must avoid these flying saucers by maneuvering out of their way or by shooting them down. In sector 1.3., a new type of robot spaceship (at least one) will fly erratically and attempt to crash into the player's space ship (due to the marvel of technology of that era, enemy ships that disappear from one side of the screen, will emerge on the other side of the screen). Later sectors will gradually introduce more difficult challenges.</p> <p>The game ends when the player loses all three lives by crashing into (or being crashed by, it seems sometimes) pylons or enemy space ships. Although there is no penalty in avoiding pylons altogether, the game will also end if the allocated amount of time (indicated by a long bar at the top center screen) runs out. The player may increase speed to move faster, which will present maneuverability challenges in itself. The overall score increases by distance traveled, pylons traveled through, and enemy spaceships shot down. The latest score and the high score are saved and shown in the main menu.</p>	1813	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Behind view, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed	6.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/1813/buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom/	82		PC Booter (1984), Commodore 64 (1983), Atari 2600 (1983-11), ColecoVision (1984-04), Apple II (1984), Atari 5200 (1983-11), Atari 8-bit (1983-11), ZX Spectrum (1985-07), VIC-20 (1983-11), TI-99/4A (1984-02), MSX (1983), SG-1000 (1985), Arcade (1982), Coleco Adam (1983)	[{'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 384, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1430395-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-apple-ii-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0cc4dc06-ab75-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 560}, {'caption': 'A large enemy appears', 'height': 265, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1431714-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-vic-20-a-large-enemy-appears.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0f493bac-ab75-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 384}, {'caption': 'Best scores', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16259199-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-arcade-best-scores.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/941d841e-c1e1-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'The Space Warp tunnel', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/9475626-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-coleco-adam-the-space-warp-tunnel.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/54960cd4-ac07-11ed-87d3-02420a000134.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16461184-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-sg-1000-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b9266c22-c221-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4173657-buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom-commodore-64-front-cover.jpg	['Commodore 64']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/759fca50-aba8-11ed-b325-02420a00019e.webp	548

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</p>	9306	Basic Genres: Racing / Driving, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Vehicular Themes: Automobile, Vehicular Themes: Track racing	7.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9306/bump-n-jump/	31		NES (1986-10-08), Atari 2600 (1983-11), ColecoVision (1984-06), Intellivision (1983-11), PSP (2010-06-22), PlayStation 3 (2010-06-22), PS Vita (2012-02-22), Sharp X1 (1985), PlayStation 4 (2020-09-24), Arcade (1982-11), Coleco Adam (1984-06), Sharp MZ-80K/700/800/1500 (1985), Nintendo Switch (2020-09-24), Antstream (2019)	"[{'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1454981-bump-n-jump-intellivision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/42a7635c-ab75-11ed-9377-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1452364-bump-n-jump-nes-title.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/3c1e85d8-ab75-11ed-a13c-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Get the ""P"" to receive more fuel', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1453352-bump-n-jump-nes-get-the-p-to-receive-more-fuel.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/3e7cea54-ab75-11ed-a13c-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Racing...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1454432-bump-n-jump-atari-2600-racing.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/41407724-ab75-11ed-9ae2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Another river', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16389350-bump-n-jump-arcade-another-river.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4a3d8b5c-c20c-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 240}]"	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3887792-bump-n-jump-intellivision-front-cover.jpg	['Intellivision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/72b99b04-ab9e-11ed-a218-02420a00019e.webp	585

Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also ""bump"" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</p> <p>Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.</p>"	467	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Platform	6.9	https://www.mobygames.com/game/467/burgertime/	155		PC Booter (1983), NES (1985-11-27), Commodore 64 (1984), Atari 2600 (1983-08), ColecoVision (1984-04), Intellivision (1983), Apple II (1983), TI-99/4A (1983-11), MSX (1986), BREW (2006-08-31), J2ME (2006-07-12), Wii (2011-07-12), Sharp X1 (1985), Mattel Aquarius (1983), PlayStation 4 (2020-07-30), Arcade (1982-08), Coleco Adam (1984-04), Sharp MZ-80K/700/800/1500 (1985), PC-8000 (1985), Nintendo Switch (2020-07-30), Antstream (2019-07-01)	"[{'caption': 'Spray enemies like this hot dog with pepper', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1469255-burgertime-commodore-64-spray-enemies-like-this-hot-dog-with-pep.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/62d7615e-ab75-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Stage 3, I like my eggs with pepper', 'height': 400, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/8705961-burgertime-sharp-x1-stage-3-i-like-my-eggs-with-pepper.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f3782ea6-ac00-11ed-a631-02420a000135.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Collect the root beer for an additional pepper', 'height': 384, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1469483-burgertime-apple-ii-collect-the-root-beer-for-an-additional-pepp.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6345c3e2-ab75-11ed-8e21-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 560}, {'caption': 'Gameplay on the first level', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1466567-burgertime-nes-gameplay-on-the-first-level.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5d76e39c-ab75-11ed-bddc-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': ""Don't get knocked out by an egg yolk"", 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1471919-burgertime-commodore-64-dont-get-knocked-out-by-an-egg-yolk.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/690f1dbe-ab75-11ed-89d0-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 320}]"	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3928947-burgertime-intellivision-front-cover.jpg	['Intellivision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/e46ce4d0-ab9f-11ed-a5ec-02420a00019b.webp	581

Centipede	Windows Phone release: Game Room: Centipede	<p>In <em>Centipede</em>, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which are attacking the player in continuous waves. </p> <p>The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid-fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Insect Opponents and Mushrooms</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Centipede</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.</p> <p>Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Spider</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit at closer distances.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Flea</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Scorpion</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mushrooms</strong>  </li> </ul> <p>Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.</p> <p><strong>Game Difficulty and Variations</strong>  </p> <p>The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:</p> <ul> <li>One Player</li> <li>Two Player Alternating  </li> </ul> <p>Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.</p> <ul> <li>Dual Player Competition  </li> </ul> <p>Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.</p> <ul> <li>Team Play</li> </ul> <p>Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined.

Combat	Title on the end label of original release: 01 Combat, Brazilian title: Combate, Zellers title: Front Line, Sears Tele-Games title: Tank-Plus	"<p><em>Combat</em> is a two-player game where the players attempt to shoot each other's tanks or planes. Hitting the enemy vehicle pushes it back and gives the player one point. The game contains 27 levels, each of which has different rules and playing field layout. On the tank levels, the players have a selection of two different mazes or no walls at all, while on the plane levels, the players can choose to play with clouds that obscure part of the screen. The Atari 2600 difficulty settings can be used to change the range of a player's missiles, as well as the speed of one's airplanes in levels 15-27. All games have a time limit of 136 seconds. </p> <p>The levels include: </p> <ul> <li>1-5: Tank levels. Levels 3 and 5 are ""straight missile"" levels where the players' projectiles simply fly forward. On the ""guided missile"" levels (1, 2, 4) the projectiles can be controlled with a joystick after firing.</li> <li>6-9: ""Tank-pong"" levels, where the players' missiles bounce off walls. In the ""billiard hit"" levels (8 and 9), there's an additional rule that a missile must bounce at least once before it can hit the enemy tank.</li> <li>10 and 11: Invisible tank levels, where the tanks only become briefly visible when they shoot, bump into a wall, or are hit by a missile. Both of these give the players guided missiles.</li> <li>12-14: Invisible ""tank-pong"" levels. Levels 13 and 14 use the ""billiard hit"" rule.</li> <li>15-20: Biplane levels, where the players fly planes that are constantly moving forward and wrap around to the other side when they fly off the screen. Levels 15 and 19 use guided missiles; 16 and 20 use straight missiles; on 17 and 18, the players use rapid-fire machine guns. Additionally, level 19 is a ""2 vs. 2"" level - both players have two planes each that move and shoot together - and level 20 is ""1 vs. 3"", where one player has three planes while the other has a single large plane.</li> <li>21-27: Jet fighter levels. The jet planes move faster than biplanes, but other than that gameplay remains similar. 22, 24, and 27 are straight missile levels, the rest are guided-missile levels. Additionally, 25 and 27 are ""2 vs. 2"" levels, while 26 is a ""1 vs. 3"" level.</li> </ul>"	8851	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Flight / aviation, Vehicular Themes: Tank	6.8	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8851/combat/	55		Windows (2004), Atari 2600 (1977-10-14), Xbox 360 (2010-03-24), Antstream (2023-07-11), Plex Arcade (2021-01-26)	[{'caption': 'Biplane combat', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1882210-combat-atari-2600-biplane-combat.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1ee98536-ab79-11ed-ab77-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Level 26: 1 vs. 3 jetplanes', 'height': 210, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16011788-combat-atari-2600-level-26-1-vs-3-jetplanes.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4cbd9fa8-bf2c-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Jet combat', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1882332-combat-atari-2600-jet-combat.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1f2e689a-ab79-11ed-ab77-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Tank combat with walls and reflective shots', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1882061-combat-atari-2600-tank-combat-with-walls-and-reflective-shots.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1e9c91c2-ab79-11ed-ab77-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Tank combat with some obstacles', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1881887-combat-atari-2600-tank-combat-with-some-obstacles.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1e2b769a-ab79-11ed-ab77-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/6652008-combat-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/1be34f4e-abf0-11ed-a161-02420a000136.webp	583

Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill from distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</p>	1618	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Diagonal-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Narrative Theme/Topic: War, Other Attributes: Regional differences	7.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/1618/commando/	217		PC Booter (1988-12), Amiga (1990), NES (1986-09-27), Atari ST (1990), Commodore 64 (1985-12), Atari 2600 (1988-06), Intellivision (1987-12), Apple II (1988-06), Atari 7800 (1989-11), ZX Spectrum (1985), MSX (1987), Amstrad CPC (1986-05), Xbox 360 (2013-04-16), DoJa (2006), PlayStation 3 (2013-04-16), Wii (2010-10-05), iPhone (2017-03-23), Android (2017-03-23), BBC Micro (1985), Electron (1986), PC-88 (1987-03), iPad (2017-03-23), FM-7 (1987-05), Arcade (1985-05)	[{'caption': 'Crossing a bridge', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1931394-commando-amiga-crossing-a-bridge.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/94e35168-ab79-11ed-837d-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Five bombs located near a bridge', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15729660-commando-amstrad-cpc-five-bombs-located-near-a-bridge.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/92fede5e-bed3-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Get rid of dangerous mortars first', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1931764-commando-zx-spectrum-get-rid-of-dangerous-mortars-first.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/95c8cb44-ab79-11ed-b042-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1928409-commando-intellivision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/8d014c5c-ab79-11ed-aecf-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': '1st Area complete, time for a smoke', 'height': 400, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/9409734-commando-pc-88-1st-area-complete-time-for-a-smoke.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/c2b8725c-ac06-11ed-9f52-02420a000130.webp', 'width': 640}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3719370-commando-zx-spectrum-front-cover.jpg	['ZX Spectrum']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/c22d28d2-ab98-11ed-b165-02420a000198.webp	523

Cosmic Ark		<p>The Alpha Ro solar system is in crisis! Their sun is about to go supernova, meaning the death of all the many planets and the exotic lifeforms who call them home. Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.</p> <p><em>Cosmic Ark</em> features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment.

Dark Chambers		"<p><em>Dark Chambers</em> is an arcade action game similar to <a href=""https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Gauntlet"">Gauntlet</a>. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</p>"	9550	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter	5.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9550/dark-chambers/	11		Atari 2600 (1989-05), Atari 7800 (1989-04), Atari 8-bit (1989-04), Antstream (2021-09-14), Plex Arcade (2021-01-26)	[{'caption': 'Exploring the chambers', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/433074-dark-chambers-atari-2600-exploring-the-chambers.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0de854bc-ab6d-11ed-99ae-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Ready for the next level?', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15654738-dark-chambers-atari-8-bit-ready-for-the-next-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/722c9e86-bdf3-11ed-a067-02420a0001bb.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Game over', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/435895-dark-chambers-atari-2600-game-over.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1389a6dc-ab6d-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Skeletons and other creatures here', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/432348-dark-chambers-atari-2600-skeletons-and-other-creatures-here.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0c7a6804-ab6d-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Found an item in the corner here...', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15644873-dark-chambers-atari-8-bit-found-an-item-in-the-corner-here.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/fd30a950-bdee-11ed-b791-02420a0001bb.webp', 'width': 336}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4109682-dark-chambers-atari-7800-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 7800']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/26672138-aba6-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp	578

Demons to Diamonds		<p>In <em>Demons to Diamonds</em>, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</p>	9263	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter	6.1	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9263/demons-to-diamonds/	12		Windows (2010-05-19), Atari 2600 (1982-07), Xbox 360 (2010-05-19)	[{'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/333817-demons-to-diamonds-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/46c6f1fe-ab6c-11ed-ac16-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Shoot demons the same color as your zapper', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/369340-demons-to-diamonds-atari-2600-shoot-demons-the-same-color-as-you.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/8e0a61c2-ab6c-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A two player game', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1685279-demons-to-diamonds-atari-2600-a-two-player-game.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/52e9d37e-ab77-11ed-9505-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Watch out for skulls!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1688276-demons-to-diamonds-atari-2600-watch-out-for-skulls.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/59f593e2-ab77-11ed-b6ec-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3894377-demons-to-diamonds-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/afa35172-ab9e-11ed-9d05-02420a000198.webp	584

Donkey Kong	Common abbreviation: DK, e-Reader title: Donkey Kong-e	"<p>Released in the arcades in 1981, <em>Donkey Kong</em> was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company but marked the introduction of two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally ""Jumpman"") and Donkey Kong.</p> <p><em>Donkey Kong</em> is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial-themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.</p> <p>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, ""living"" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse, and umbrella for additional bonus points.</p> <p><em>Donkey Kong</em> is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.

Donkey Kong Junior	ColecoVision in-game title: Donkey Kong Jr, Title on most versions: Donkey Kong Jr., e-Reader title: Donkey Kong Jr.-e	<p>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!</p> <p><em>Donkey Kong Jr.</em> was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's father.</p> <p>Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.</p> <p>Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.</p> <p>In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.</p> <p>Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</p>	7302	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Platform	6.7	https://www.mobygames.com/game/7302/donkey-kong-junior/	146		Game Boy Advance (2002), NES (1983-07-15), Atari 2600 (1983-09), ColecoVision (1983), Intellivision (1983), Atari 7800 (1988-11), Atari 8-bit (1984-03), Wii (2006-12-02), Nintendo 3DS (2011-09-01), Wii U (2013-04-26), Arcade (1982-08), Coleco Adam (1984-04), Nintendo Switch (2018-12-21)	[{'caption': 'The game options', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1886387-donkey-kong-junior-colecovision-the-game-options.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/28f1dda8-ab79-11ed-9377-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Stage 4', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2797254-donkey-kong-junior-nes-stage-4.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4719eb44-ab84-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Title screen 1', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/9545626-donkey-kong-junior-coleco-adam-title-screen-1.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f4291ffc-ac07-11ed-9915-02420a000134.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1889471-donkey-kong-junior-colecovision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/2faecba6-ab79-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Gameplay on the first level', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1887012-donkey-kong-junior-intellivision-gameplay-on-the-first-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/2a3b9e38-ab79-11ed-9377-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/108674-donkey-kong-junior-colecovision-front-cover.jpg	['ColecoVision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/75f52d26-ab6a-11ed-bc1c-02420a00019a.webp	588

E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial	Informal slang title: E.T. The Game	<p><em>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</em> is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. </p> <p>The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. </p> <p>Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</p>	8874	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Diagonal-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Puzzle elements, Other Attributes: Licensed	3.2	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8874/et-the-extra-terrestrial/	131		Atari 2600 (1982-11)	[{'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1238079-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/7715d012-ab73-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Exploring a bit...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1238269-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-exploring-a-bit.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/77742ce8-ab73-11ed-b430-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Uh oh, in trouble here...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1237601-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-uh-oh-in-trouble-here.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/76257f2c-ab73-11ed-8d2b-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Found something in a hole!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1239421-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-found-something-in-a-hole.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/79ce929e-ab73-11ed-b430-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Beginning the game', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1237647-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-beginning-the-game.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/76359b64-ab73-11ed-b430-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4828326-et-the-extra-terrestrial-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/cb4d719a-abc2-11ed-ba04-02420a00019f.webp	583

You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder.

Frogger	Working title for the arcade version: Highway Crossing Frog, Atari 2600 Starpath Supercharger title: The Official Frogger	<p>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.</p> <p>The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</p>	1540	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Interface/Control: Direct control	7.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/1540/frogger/	238		PC Booter (1983), Game Boy (1998-08), Game Boy Color (1998), SNES (1998-08), Genesis (1998), Commodore 64 (1983), Atari 2600 (1982-08), ColecoVision (1983-11), Intellivision (1983-04), Apple II (1983), Atari 5200 (1983-06), Atari 8-bit (1982), VIC-20 (1983-07), TI-99/4A (1983-06), MSX (1983), TRS-80 (1982), TRS-80 CoCo (1983), BREW (2003-11-20), J2ME (2003-11-20), Macintosh (1984), Odyssey 2 (1982), Dragon 32/64 (1983), iPhone (2008-08-27), Android (2010-12-16), iPad (2011-10-14), Windows Phone (2010-11-08), ZX81 (1982), PlayStation 4 (2019-12-12), Arcade (1981), PC-6001 (1981), Tomy Tutor (1982), Timex Sinclair 2068 (1984), Nintendo Switch (2019-12-12)	"[{'caption': 'The frog crosses the road', 'height': 265, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/4505170-frogger-vic-20-the-frog-crosses-the-road.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/8f368bae-abb5-11ed-a061-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 384}, {'caption': 'My frog got squished crossing the road (Parker cartridge version)', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/4505566-frogger-atari-8-bit-my-frog-got-squished-crossing-the-road-parke.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/935412f6-abb5-11ed-a061-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'First stage, crossing the street.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15844526-frogger-odyssey-2-first-stage-crossing-the-street.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d24b0f64-bef7-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'After the first move, on the dangerous street (Sierra Harris version)', 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15826010-frogger-atari-8-bit-after-the-first-move-on-the-dangerous-street.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/33e32bae-bef2-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': ""In the Sierra version by Chuck Benton, there's even a 2-player simultaneous mode"", 'height': 224, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15826973-frogger-atari-8-bit-in-the-sierra-version-by-chuck-benton-theres.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/83f921c0-bef2-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 336}]"	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/10064666-frogger-trs-80-front-cover.jpg	['TRS-80']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/ce92b0c8-ac0c-11ed-b85a-02420a000135.webp	636

Ghostbusters	Working title: Car Wars, Spanish Spectrum reissue title: Cazafantasmas, French title: S.O.S. Fantômes	"<p>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to ""bust"" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated ""proton packs"" and ""ghost traps"", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the ""PK level"" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.</p> <p><em>Ghostbusters</em> is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for ""ghost alarms"", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).</p> <p>As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</p>"	2619	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Other Attributes: Licensed	6.4	https://www.mobygames.com/game/2619/ghostbusters/	214		PC Booter (1986), NES (1986-09-22), SEGA Master System (1987-05), Commodore 64 (1984-10), Atari 2600 (1985), Apple II (1984-12), Atari 8-bit (1985-01), ZX Spectrum (1985), MSX (1985), Amstrad CPC (1985)	"[{'caption': 'A ""Slimer"" in a box being transported to the car.

Gyruss		<p>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single cannon, but can gain a double cannon after shooting a power up satellite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. <em>Gyruss</em> is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of <em>Gyruss</em> adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</p>	7720	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Behind view, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	6.7	https://www.mobygames.com/game/7720/gyruss/	70		Windows (2010-07-14), NES (1988-11-18), Commodore 64 (1984-06), Atari 2600 (1984-06), ColecoVision (1984-06), Atari 5200 (1984-06), Atari 8-bit (1984-06), Xbox 360 (2007-04-18), Arcade (1983-03)	[{'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1022953-gyruss-atari-8-bit-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/c0b6f1f8-ab71-11ed-9ab3-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1025471-gyruss-colecovision-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/c7470b8e-ab71-11ed-b165-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Shoot the middle satelite for double fire', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1019793-gyruss-commodore-64-shoot-the-middle-satelite-for-double-fire.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b9b761bc-ab71-11ed-a188-02420a00019a.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1025368-gyruss-colecovision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/c7120182-ab71-11ed-b165-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Destroy every ship in the bonus stage for a 10k bonus', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/8546549-gyruss-arcade-destroy-every-ship-in-the-bonus-stage-for-a-10k-bo.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/56040024-abff-11ed-81c5-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 224}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/463243-gyruss-commodore-64-front-cover.jpg	['Commodore 64']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/4a496ae0-ab6d-11ed-9e18-02420a00019a.webp	525
Haunted House	Brazilian title: Casa Mal-Assombrada, Original title: Nightmare Manor	<p>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.</p> <p>The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!</p> <p>You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter. You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score.</p>	9751	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Interface/Control: Direct control, Narrative Theme/Topic: Horror	6.7	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9751/haunted-house/	28		Windows (2010-05-26), Atari 2600 (1981), Xbox 360 (2010-05-26), Antstream (2020-10-06), Plex Arcade (2021-01-26)	"[{'caption': 'A vampire bat enters the room.', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3461068-haunted-house-atari-2600-a-vampire-bat-enters-the-room.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/53dad4b8-ab90-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The ghost!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3460845-haunted-house-atari-2600-the-ghost.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/51f9cae6-ab90-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Exploring the mansion.', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3460493-haunted-house-atari-2600-exploring-the-mansion.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4e7698d6-ab90-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': ""You can't see the walls in the more advanced game variations."", 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3461258-haunted-house-atari-2600-you-cant-see-the-walls-in-the-more-adva.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/55682510-ab90-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Use a match to see objects.', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3460659-haunted-house-atari-2600-use-a-match-to-see-objects.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/502e2914-ab90-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}]"	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3892904-haunted-house-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/a1f90f9e-ab9e-11ed-ba50-02420a000199.webp	585

Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.</p>	9113	Basic Genres: Puzzle, Perspective: Top-down, Pacing: Turn-based, Gameplay: Board game, Gameplay: Cards / tiles, Gameplay: Mental training, Gameplay: Tile matching puzzle, Interface/Control: Direct control	4.8	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9113/hunt-score/	10		Windows (2010-09-01), Atari 2600 (1978), Xbox 360 (2010-09-01)	[{'caption': 'A game on the 16 square grid', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1286246-hunt-score-atari-2600-a-game-on-the-16-square-grid.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d9ea0654-ab73-11ed-ba04-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The game in black and white mode', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1286559-hunt-score-atari-2600-the-game-in-black-and-white-mode.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/da851ab8-ab73-11ed-ba04-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A game on the 30 square grid', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1286407-hunt-score-atari-2600-a-game-on-the-30-square-grid.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/da3b142c-ab73-11ed-ba04-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3898476-hunt-score-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/d4b61d1e-ab9e-11ed-bd13-02420a00019c.webp	581

Joust	Tag-lined title: Joust: A Game of Combat, Action and Skill	"<p>In <em>Joust</em>, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.</p> <p>Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded ""unbeatable""(?) pterodactyl.</p> <p>The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</p>"	4059	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Platform	7.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/4059/joust/	122		Lynx (1992), NES (1987-10-30), Atari ST (1986), Atari 2600 (1983-10), Apple II (1984-07), Atari 5200 (1983-10), Atari 7800 (1986-05), Atari 8-bit (1984-01), Palm OS (2002-11-05), Xbox 360 (2005-11-22), Macintosh (1994), Arcade (1982), Antstream (2021-04-06)	[{'caption': 'Game running in double-pixel mode', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15769368-joust-macintosh-game-running-in-double-pixel-mode.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e81be654-bee0-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Game over', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16418054-joust-arcade-game-over.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/334c346c-c215-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 292}, {'caption': 'Atari logo and title', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/492016-joust-atari-5200-atari-logo-and-title.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/83c5e3ac-ab6d-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Beginning a game', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10264817-joust-nes-beginning-a-game.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b933a5be-ac0e-11ed-b351-02420a00012e.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Some jousting in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1525128-joust-atari-7800-some-jousting-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e0efaaa6-ab75-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3978153-joust-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/9780c36a-aba1-11ed-b165-02420a000198.webp	580
Jr. Pac-Man		"<p><em>Jr. Pac-Man</em> features gameplay similar to the original <a href=""https://www.mobygames.com/game/138/pac-man/"">Pac-Man</a>, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</p>"	9065	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Interface/Control: Direct control	7.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9065/jr-pac-man/	34		DOS (1988), Commodore 64 (1988), Atari 2600 (1986-10), Arcade (1983-12)	[{'caption': 'A bonus to collect.', 'height': 288, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16169239-jr-pac-man-arcade-a-bonus-to-collect.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/262fdb48-c1c6-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 224}, {'caption': 'Dead.', 'height': 288, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16169344-jr-pac-man-arcade-dead.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/2adbfb72-c1c6-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 224}, {'caption': 'Maze one', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1523381-jr-pac-man-commodore-64-maze-one.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dd416188-ab75-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1526645-jr-pac-man-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e52a9a72-ab75-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Maze two', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1524676-jr-pac-man-commodore-64-maze-two.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dfd7e052-ab75-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3975075-jr-pac-man-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/7d18f7d6-aba1-11ed-beab-02420a000199.webp	576

Keystone Kapers	Zellers release title: Busy Police	<p>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four-story mall and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level.

Krull		<p>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! </p> <p>You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.</p> <p>The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.</p> <p>In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. </p> <p>Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</p>	9700	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Diagonal-down, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Interface/Control: Direct control, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed		https://www.mobygames.com/game/9700/krull/	8		Atari 2600 (1983-11)	[{'caption': 'Arrived at the fortress of the beast', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1694594-krull-atari-2600-arrived-at-the-fortress-of-the-beast.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/68cbe0e2-ab77-11ed-b6ee-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Under attack from the Slayers!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1696301-krull-atari-2600-under-attack-from-the-slayers.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6cde2c30-ab77-11ed-8048-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1695770-krull-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6b4ef8ae-ab77-11ed-8048-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The web of the crystal spider', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1694200-krull-atari-2600-the-web-of-the-crystal-spider.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/67f48656-ab77-11ed-b6ee-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Riding off to the next destination', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1696525-krull-atari-2600-riding-off-to-the-next-destination.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6d8767dc-ab77-11ed-8048-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3894474-krull-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/b08ab94a-ab9e-11ed-9d80-02420a00019a.webp	586

Laser Blast		<p>In Laser Blast, you control an intergalactic spacecraft, and you need to destroy enemy ground forces. Using your laser blasts, try to destroy the enemy vehicles which appear three at a time. But be careful, they are fully armed with their own lasers and have no intention of letting you take them out easily! The more enemy vehicles you destroy, the more points you earn. If you do get hit by a laser blast, your spacecraft will fall to the ground and crash. When hit you still have one last chance to take out an enemy by maneuvering the spacecraft to crash land on top of it.</p>	9008	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	6.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9008/laser-blast/	19		Windows (2010-06-23), Atari 2600 (1981), Xbox 360 (2010-06-23)	[{'caption': 'Firing laser blasts', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/374205-laser-blast-atari-2600-firing-laser-blasts.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/97b68200-ab6c-11ed-9377-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The game in black and white mode', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1728545-laser-blast-atari-2600-the-game-in-black-and-white-mode.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b64907c8-ab77-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Avoid enemy fire', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1728037-laser-blast-atari-2600-avoid-enemy-fire.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b538dcdc-ab77-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Try to crash land on an enemy when you are hit', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1728374-laser-blast-atari-2600-try-to-crash-land-on-an-enemy-when-you-ar.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b5eb5920-ab77-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3980714-laser-blast-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/accbccd8-aba1-11ed-b430-02420a0001a0.webp	588

You need to earn points by destroying as many of these strange attackers as you can before your energy supply becomes depleted.</p>"	9011	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	7.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9011/megamania/	20		Windows (2010-05-05), Atari 2600 (1982-09), Atari 5200 (1983-11), Atari 8-bit (1984-02), Xbox 360 (2010-05-05)	[{'caption': 'Whatever these are, they rotate.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3490529-megamania-atari-8-bit-whatever-these-are-they-rotate.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/43b477b4-ab91-11ed-b042-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Incoming radial tires!', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2020544-megamania-atari-5200-incoming-radial-tires.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/735d1262-ab7a-11ed-837d-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3489740-megamania-atari-8-bit-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/3d6e86ba-ab91-11ed-93d8-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'These also get lower as the level progresses.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3490775-megamania-atari-8-bit-these-also-get-lower-as-the-level-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4578dff4-ab91-11ed-b042-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Fighting some green things...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2019896-megamania-atari-2600-fighting-some-green-things.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/71c5a2ca-ab7a-11ed-837d-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3991359-megamania-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/0dcbbc6e-aba2-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp	587
Millipede	Original title: Centipede Deluxe	"<p>Millipedes, cousins of the Centipede, are all over the garden. This will ruin anything trying to grow there unless they are stopped. But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies, and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.</p> <p>Millipede is the sequel to <a href=""https://www.mobygames.com/game/141/centipede/"">Centipede</a>, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally DDT will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well-timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</p>"	9112	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter	6.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9112/millipede/	32		Windows (2004), NES (1987-10-01), Atari ST (1986), Atari 2600 (1984-03), Atari 8-bit (1984-08), Xbox 360 (2010-03-24), Browser (2010-08), Arcade (1982-11), Antstream (2021-11-16), Plex Arcade (2021-01-26)	[{'caption': 'Avoid that spider.', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16417946-millipede-arcade-avoid-that-spider.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/29a27fca-c215-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 240}, {'caption': 'Kill the Millipede.', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16418018-millipede-arcade-kill-the-millipede.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/30babb06-c215-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 240}, {'caption': 'Shooting dynamite', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2061758-millipede-atari-st-shooting-dynamite.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e0552ad0-ab7a-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Shooting dynamite...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2060796-millipede-atari-2600-shooting-dynamite.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dd84ef34-ab7a-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2059779-millipede-atari-8-bit-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dad831ec-ab7a-11ed-b6ee-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 336}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/10601773-millipede-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/8969836e-ac11-11ed-962d-02420a000135.webp	578
Miner 2049er	Tag-lined title: Miner 2049er: Starring Bounty Bob	<p>You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.</p> <p>You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.</p> <p>There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.</p>	8724	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Platform	7.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8724/miner-2049er/	65		PC Booter (1983), Commodore 64 (1983), Atari 2600 (1983-05), ColecoVision (1983-08), Apple II (1982), Atari 5200 (1983-07), Atari 8-bit (1982), VIC-20 (1984), TI-99/4A (1983-10), BREW (2007-06-05), J2ME (2007-06-05), Windows Mobile (2008), BlackBerry (2007-06-06), PC-88 (1984-04), Sharp X1 (1984), FM-7 (1984-05), Thomson TO (1985), Epoch Super Cassette Vision (1985), Thomson MO (1985), SMC-777 (1984)	[{'caption': 'Station 1', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/7090178-miner-2049er-ti-994a-station-1.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9a10724a-abf3-11ed-9b47-02420a000133.webp', 'width': 304}, {'caption': 'Some slides and many little platforms on level five', 'height': 400, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2062205-miner-2049er-pc-booter-some-slides-and-many-little-platforms-on-.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e16b0750-ab7a-11ed-9d05-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Entering Zone 1', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1865286-miner-2049er-atari-8-bit-entering-zone-1.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f594b02a-ab78-11ed-aaf5-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Gameplay on the first level', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2062942-miner-2049er-commodore-64-gameplay-on-the-first-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e3214064-ab7a-11ed-a5ec-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Gameplay on the first level', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2063056-miner-2049er-colecovision-gameplay-on-the-first-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e36a4354-ab7a-11ed-9d05-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 256}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4214659-miner-2049er-apple-ii-front-cover.jpg	['Apple II']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/042df7a0-abaa-11ed-b9a3-02420a000197.webp	517

Montezuma's Revenge	Tag-lined title: Montezuma's Revenge: Featuring Panama Joe, ZX Spectrum title: Panama Joe, Italian title: Predatore	<p>You play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by Aztec warrior  deep inside catacombs. But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death. He will also find amulets which make him invulnerable for a short time. Except for the Master System version, they are activated directly when picked up.</p> <p>The Atari 2600 port is a truncated version of the game and has only 24 rooms instead of 100. The room layouts are more of an approximation of the original version than being a direct copy due to the limited power of the console. The ZX Spectrum version has identical room layouts, however, the rooms are arranged differently and a few were removed. The Normal Distribution port has both a retro and modern mode. While the retro mode attempts to be faithful to the original version, the modern mode offers enhanced visuals plus has scrolling instead of the flip-screen of the original.</p>	1178	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Metroidvania, Gameplay: Platform	7.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/1178/montezumas-revenge/	80		Windows (2020-10-13), PC Booter (1984), SEGA Master System (1989-06), Commodore 64 (1984-10), Atari 2600 (1984-09), ColecoVision (1984-10), Apple II (1984), Atari 5200 (1984-09), Atari 8-bit (1984-09), ZX Spectrum (1984)	[{'caption': 'Magma chamber', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16376645-montezumas-revenge-atari-8-bit-magma-chamber.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/df1709f0-c208-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Climbing down the rope to start off the game.', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/12652930-montezumas-revenge-zx-spectrum-climbing-down-the-rope-to-start-o.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/cea69744-ac22-11ed-8ce3-02420a000131.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'This is a dangerous looking room...', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2078134-montezumas-revenge-atari-5200-this-is-a-dangerous-looking-room.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/09eb61c0-ab7b-11ed-a218-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Can you reach the keys safely?', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2080945-montezumas-revenge-colecovision-can-you-reach-the-keys-safely.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/10edd43a-ab7b-11ed-99ae-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Long ladder', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16376651-montezumas-revenge-atari-8-bit-long-ladder.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/df4647ce-c208-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 336}]	670	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4357565-montezumas-revenge-pc-booter-front-cover.jpg	['PC Booter', 'Apple II']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/a5abee3e-abaf-11ed-bd13-02420a00019c.webp	596

Mr. Do!		<p>You control Mr. Do as he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the bad guys in two ways: firstly, he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again.

This sequel continued on the ""eat the dots/avoid the ghosts"" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.</p> <p>Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.</p> <p>Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800, and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.</p> <p>Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of ""Junior"".</p>"	576	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade	7.1	https://www.mobygames.com/game/576/ms-pac-man/	343		Windows (2016-04-20), PC Booter (1984-07), Game Boy (1993-10), Xbox (2004-11-04), SNES (1996-08-01), Genesis (1991), Lynx (1990), NES (1990), Game Gear (1995), SEGA Master System (1991), Commodore 64 (1984), Atari 2600 (1983-02), Apple II (1984-04), Atari 5200 (1983-09), Atari 7800 (1986-05), Atari 8-bit (1983-11), ZX Spectrum (1985-12), VIC-20 (1984-03), TI-99/4A (1984-04), Palm OS (2004-11-10), Xbox 360 (2007-01-10), iPod Classic (2007-02-27), iPhone (2008-07-10), BlackBerry (2009-11-23), Android (2010-10-16), PlayStation 4 (2016-04-20), Xbox One (2016-04-20), Arcade (1982-02-03)	[{'caption': 'Title Screen.', 'height': 288, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16409420-ms-pac-man-arcade-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9ef7fafa-c212-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 224}, {'caption': 'Title screen (by Namco, Thunder Mountain)', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16240744-ms-pac-man-pc-booter-title-screen-by-namco-thunder-mountain.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5fd95ea8-c1dc-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Eat the ghosts now!', 'height': 102, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15740814-ms-pac-man-lynx-eat-the-ghosts-now.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/646fb730-bed7-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'Caught by the ghost so one life is lost', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2103824-ms-pac-man-zx-spectrum-caught-by-the-ghost-so-one-life-is-lost.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4c4790ac-ab7b-11ed-b6ee-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Title screen / the game screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2100453-ms-pac-man-atari-2600-title-screen-the-game-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/42d5d808-ab7b-11ed-b325-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3996775-ms-pac-man-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/3b60bde6-aba2-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp	568
Night Driver		<p>Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.</p>	9750	Basic Genres: Action, Basic Genres: Racing / Driving, Perspective: 1st-person, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Automobile, Vehicular Themes: Track racing	5.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9750/night-driver/	31		Windows (2010-05-12), Commodore 64 (1982), Atari 2600 (1980), Xbox 360 (2010-05-12), Arcade (1976-10), Antstream (2021-12-14)	[{'caption': 'Long curve ', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16421699-night-driver-arcade-long-curve.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5d45e15e-c216-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'A race in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2143231-night-driver-commodore-64-a-race-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b4177be8-ab7b-11ed-9e47-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Bezel artwork provided the front-end of the car.', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15918667-night-driver-arcade-bezel-artwork-provided-the-front-end-of-the-.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b5f44eea-bf0e-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Night', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16421696-night-driver-arcade-night.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/5d214f7e-c216-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'The screen flashes when you crash', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2142622-night-driver-atari-2600-the-screen-flashes-when-you-crash.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b2a6ca48-ab7b-11ed-9e47-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3902916-night-driver-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/fc8f8e2e-ab9e-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp	594

Pitfall II: Lost Caverns	Alternate title: David Crane's Pitfall II: Lost Caverns	"<p>You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, her cat Quickclaw and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes. Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats, and other hazards get in the way.</p> <p><em>Pitfall II</em> is the sequel to <a href=""https://www.mobygames.com/game/8793/pitfall/"">Pitfall!</a>, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze-like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way, there are checkpoints the player will encounter in the form of red crosses. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.

Q*bert	Working title: Cubert, Intellivision in-game title: Gottlieb's Q*bert, Game Boy title: Q*bert for Game Boy, Working title: Snots and Boogers	<p><em>Q*bert</em> is a popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels, you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures wandering around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</p>	8853	Basic Genres: Action, Basic Genres: Puzzle, Perspective: Diagonal-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Visual Presentation: Isometric, Gameplay: Platform, Interface/Control: Direct control, Setting: Fantasy	6.8	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8853/qbert/	121		DOS (1984), Game Boy (1992), NES (1989-02), Commodore 64 (1983-11), Atari 2600 (1983-07), ColecoVision (1983), Intellivision (1983-09), Atari 5200 (1983-10), Atari 8-bit (1983-09), VIC-20 (1983), TI-99/4A (1983-08), J2ME (2003-06-13), Mophun (2002), Odyssey 2 (1982), PlayStation 3 (2007-02-22), BlackBerry (2009-01-08), SG-1000 (1983), Arcade (1982), Dedicated handheld (1983)	[{'caption': 'Level 1 intro', 'height': 144, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15751446-qbert-game-boy-level-1-intro.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e95a8f12-beda-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'Here comes the snake', 'height': 250, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15830325-qbert-odyssey-2-here-comes-the-snake.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/776136ea-bef3-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Hop on each tile twice to change the color to green on this level', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2287987-qbert-atari-2600-hop-on-each-tile-twice-to-change-the-color-to-g.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/40377898-ab7d-11ed-8ed2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Ugh and Wrong-Way jump on the side of the cubes instead of the top', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2288836-qbert-commodore-64-ugh-and-wrong-way-jump-on-the-side-of-the-cub.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/4254600a-ab7d-11ed-8ed2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Introduction scene', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/6501013-qbert-dos-introduction-scene.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f6bae566-abee-11ed-ad33-02420a00012d.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/108489-qbert-colecovision-front-cover.jpg	['ColecoVision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/7597b5f6-ab6a-11ed-bc1c-02420a00019a.webp	579

River Raid II		<p>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</p>	9074	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter	7.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9074/river-raid-ii/	6		Windows (2010-06-09), Atari 2600 (1988-11), Xbox 360 (2010-06-09)	[{'caption': 'Ready for takeoff...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2350877-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-ready-for-takeoff.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f2bf68a4-ab7d-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2350694-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f2389e00-ab7d-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Heading in for a landing...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2351555-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-heading-in-for-a-landing.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f453e6a4-ab7d-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Making your way up the river', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2351168-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-making-your-way-up-the-river.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f37326aa-ab7d-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The enemy bridge!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2351358-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-the-enemy-bridge.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f3e1457c-ab7d-11ed-98cd-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4016420-river-raid-ii-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/e9a2f298-aba2-11ed-96f9-02420a00019a.webp	584
Robot Tank		<p>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</p>	9695	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: 1st-person, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Vehicular Themes: Tank, Setting: North America	7.6	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9695/robot-tank/	10		Atari 2600 (1983-06)	[{'caption': 'Firing on an enemy tank', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2364615-robot-tank-atari-2600-firing-on-an-enemy-tank.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/19baa842-ab7e-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The rain may impede your progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2364226-robot-tank-atari-2600-the-rain-may-impede-your-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/18b03dd6-ab7e-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'It can be difficult to spot tanks in the dark...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2363799-robot-tank-atari-2600-it-can-be-difficult-to-spot-tanks-in-the-d.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/1770f9d8-ab7e-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2363464-robot-tank-atari-2600-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/167e7406-ab7e-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Can you track a tank in the fog?', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/2364432-robot-tank-atari-2600-can-you-track-a-tank-in-the-fog.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/194417c2-ab7e-11ed-87ec-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3888524-robot-tank-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/7a2284aa-ab9e-11ed-aecf-02420a000198.webp	586

Space Invaders	Sidam Italian release: Invasion, Brazilian title: Invasores do Espaço, Working title: Space Monsters	<p>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb-dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser cannon are four (or three, depending on the platform played on) shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser cannons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</p>	8806	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	7.3	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8806/space-invaders/	167		Windows 3.x (1997), Game Boy (1990-03-30), NES (1985-04-17), Atari 2600 (1980), Atari 5200 (1982), Atari 8-bit (1980), MSX (1985), J2ME (2003-07), Wii (2009-04-07), iPhone (2009-02-21), Android (2011-02-08), PC-98 (1992-01-31), iPad (2010-07-15), SG-1000 (1985), Arcade (1978), Sharp Zaurus (2001-02-09), Terminal (2002-03), Antstream (2020-03-17), iiRcade (2022-08-05)	[{'caption': 'Beware of the space invaders (S60)', 'height': 208, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15796094-space-invaders-j2me-beware-of-the-space-invaders-s60.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/7f255104-bee9-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 176}, {'caption': 'Game in progress', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/7471438-space-invaders-windows-3x-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/967f8c8a-abf6-11ed-af3d-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Game Over.', 'height': 144, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16377425-space-invaders-game-boy-game-over.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0dd61af6-c209-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'Before the title screen.', 'height': 144, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16377428-space-invaders-game-boy-before-the-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0dea71b8-c209-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'Second low of invader is hit (10 points)', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16386138-space-invaders-msx-second-low-of-invader-is-hit-10-points.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/624939c2-c20b-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 272}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4028603-space-invaders-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/5598b1b8-aba3-11ed-b6ec-02420a00019b.webp	575

Spy Hunter		<p>Originating in the arcades, <em>Spy Hunter</em> is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!). Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</p>	7668	Basic Genres: Racing / Driving, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Automobile, Vehicular Themes: Naval / watercraft	7.2	https://www.mobygames.com/game/7668/spy-hunter/	99		PC Booter (1984), NES (1987-09), Commodore 64 (1984), Atari 2600 (1984), ColecoVision (1985-01), Apple II (1983), Atari 8-bit (1984), ZX Spectrum (1985), Amstrad CPC (1986), Palm OS (2002-11-05), Browser (2000-07), BBC Micro (1986), Arcade (1983), Antstream (2021-06-28)	[{'caption': 'Driving the boat', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/438926-spy-hunter-atari-2600-driving-the-boat.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/19ae6598-ab6d-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Tire blades car', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16390040-spy-hunter-arcade-tire-blades-car.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/819e1ecc-c20c-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 480}, {'caption': 'Crossing a bridge...', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1140563-spy-hunter-commodore-64-crossing-a-bridge.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/b096cc3e-ab72-11ed-b325-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'These enemies are bullet-proof.', 'height': 386, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/15906325-spy-hunter-apple-ii-these-enemies-are-bullet-proof.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/3236f8e4-bf0b-11ed-9c42-02420a000140.webp', 'width': 562}, {'caption': 'Smoke screen ', 'height': 480, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10413711-spy-hunter-nes-smoke-screen.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f9fc58ba-ac0f-11ed-b950-02420a00012d.webp', 'width': 640}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/10214026-spy-hunter-apple-ii-front-cover.jpg	['Apple II']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/41564ba0-ac0e-11ed-98b0-02420a000130.webp	546

Star Raiders	Atari ST Title: ST Star Raiders	<p>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.</p>	9317	Basic Genres: Action, Basic Genres: Simulation, Basic Genres: Strategy / tactics, Perspective: 1st-person, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Interface/Control: Direct control, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	6.9	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9317/star-raiders/	66		Windows (2010-03-24), Atari ST (1986), Atari 2600 (1982), Atari 5200 (1982), Atari 8-bit (1980-03-05), Xbox 360 (2010-03-24)	"[{'caption': 'Entering hyperspace!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/446788-star-raiders-atari-st-entering-hyperspace.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/29605ffa-ab6d-11ed-8bed-02420a00019f.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 225, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/589214-star-raiders-atari-2600-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/54bff844-ab6e-11ed-beab-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': ""I've entered an area with enemies.

Star Wars	Title used for most console versions: Star Wars: The Arcade Game	<p><em>Star Wars</em> is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film. It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms.</p> <p>You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedoes. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.</p> <p>The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.</p>	3929	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: 1st-person, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Rail shooter, Gameplay: Shooter, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed	7.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/3929/star-wars/	114		DOS (1989), GameCube (2003), Amiga (1989), Atari ST (1987), Commodore 64 (1984-07), Atari 2600 (1984-06), ColecoVision (1984-06), Atari 5200 (1984-06), Atari 8-bit (1984-07), ZX Spectrum (1987), Amstrad CPC (1987), Macintosh (1988), BBC Micro (1987), Electron (1987), Arcade (1983-05), Antstream (2021-07-13)	"[{'caption': 'Shoot all of the towers for a bonus!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1161827-star-wars-commodore-64-shoot-all-of-the-towers-for-a-bonus.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dba8ab86-ab72-11ed-934f-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Entering a high score', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16210054-star-wars-amiga-entering-a-high-score.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/eb3da74c-c1d2-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'I died.

Star Wars: Jedi Arena		<p>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</p>	9447	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed	5.5	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9447/star-wars-jedi-arena/	10		Atari 2600 (1983-02)	[{'caption': 'Block laser bolts with your light saber', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/407792-star-wars-jedi-arena-atari-2600-block-laser-bolts-with-your-ligh.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/daf8fc46-ab6c-11ed-8ed2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Try to blast your opponents shield', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/406096-star-wars-jedi-arena-atari-2600-try-to-blast-your-opponents-shie.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/d78dc21c-ab6c-11ed-96f9-02420a00019a.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/407684-star-wars-jedi-arena-atari-2600-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/dac3de94-ab6c-11ed-8ed2-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/40726-star-wars-jedi-arena-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/22982f48-ab65-11ed-9803-02420a000173.webp	586
Star Wars: Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle		<p><em>Death Star Battle</em> is loosely based on the events of the film <em>Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</em>. Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following destruction of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.</p> <p>After completion the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc). Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</p>	8774	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Vehicular Themes: Space flight, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed	6.2	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8774/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle/	23		Atari 2600 (1983-10), Atari 5200 (1984-02), Atari 8-bit (1983), ZX Spectrum (1984)	[{'caption': 'Death Star explodes', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/356914-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-atari-2600-death-.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/75269d38-ab6c-11ed-aa5a-02420a0001a0.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Warping to fight the Death Star', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/129189-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-atari-8-bit-warpi.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9eb66892-ab6a-11ed-aaf5-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'The Death Star fires!', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/127449-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-atari-8-bit-the-d.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9b2cd468-ab6a-11ed-bddc-02420a00019e.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'Avoid enemy fighters and wait for a hole in the shield to appear.', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16310814-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-zx-spectrum-avoid.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/bd074264-c1f2-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Warping past the outer shield...', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/512518-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-atari-5200-warpin.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/acdb5b32-ab6d-11ed-81e3-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 336}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4389762-star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-death-star-battle-atari-8-bit-front.jpg	['Atari 8-bit']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/f3d7a412-abb0-11ed-b6ec-02420a00019b.webp	535
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back	In-game title: The Empire Strikes Back	<p><em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em> recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</p>	9202	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: 2D scrolling, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Shooter, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic, Other Attributes: Licensed	7.1	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9202/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back/	38		Atari 2600 (1982-07), Intellivision (1983-08)	[{'caption': 'The game in black and white mode', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/409446-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-atari-2600-the-game-in-black-a.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/de569812-ab6c-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Walkers change color as they take damage', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/410955-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-atari-2600-walkers-change-colo.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e161e93a-ab6c-11ed-beab-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Your ship and the Imperial walkers both change color as they take damage', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/421810-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-intellivision-your-ship-and-th.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f78ee244-ab6c-11ed-ac16-02420a000199.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title screen', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/419937-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-intellivision-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/f3c2998a-ab6c-11ed-ab77-02420a000198.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/411489-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-atari-2600-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e2824b7a-ab6c-11ed-aaf5-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3884949-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/586357c2-ab9e-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp	578

Super Breakout	EU René Pierre release: Special-Break, Game Boy Color in-game title: Super Breakout!, European Video Games GmbH release: Super Crash, UK Subelectro release: Super Knockout	"<p><em>Super Breakout</em> features similar gameplay to <a href=""https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Breakaway+IV"">the original</a>, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. </p> <p>This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. </p> <p>The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</p>"	9260	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Paddle / Pong, Interface/Control: Direct control	6.6	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9260/super-breakout/	39		Windows (2010-05-05), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1987), Atari 2600 (1981), Atari 5200 (1982), Atari 8-bit (1979), Xbox 360 (2010-05-05), Arcade (1978), Antstream (2021-08-24), Plex Arcade (2021-01-26)	[{'caption': 'Playing regular Breakout', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/3464074-super-breakout-atari-8-bit-playing-regular-breakout.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/6b3a2e10-ab90-11ed-a519-02420a00019d.webp', 'width': 336}, {'caption': 'I lost all my balls.

Venture		<p><em>Venture</em> is an action game in which you control Winky, the heroic adventurer. Your goal is to collect as many treasures as you can which are scattered throughout numerous dungeons. In each dungeon, there are several chambers which each contain a treasure. Armed only with your crossbow, you need to get past the varied creatures which guard the chamber, snag the treasure, and make it out again. This is made harder by the maze guardians, who roam the corridors and will pop into a chamber to chase you if you spend too much time inside. Furthermore, even after shooting a creature, you need to be careful because touching its corpse before it decays will kill you. Some chambers are trickier, containing moving walls that must be avoided, or walls that vanish suddenly to release a pack of ferocious creatures. </p> <p>When you collect the treasure from each of the chambers in a dungeon, you can then move on to the next, more difficult dungeon.</p>	9771	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Setting: Fantasy	6.9	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9771/venture/	29		Atari 2600 (1982-09), ColecoVision (1982), Intellivision (1983-01), Arcade (1981)	[{'caption': 'The treasures you have so far...', 'height': 192, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/431752-venture-colecovision-the-treasures-you-have-so-far.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0b499086-ab6d-11ed-aaf5-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'The second level', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/433939-venture-atari-2600-the-second-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0faf555c-ab6d-11ed-a188-02420a00019a.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Try to get the treasure out of the chamber', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/431833-venture-atari-2600-try-to-get-the-treasure-out-of-the-chamber.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0b70776e-ab6d-11ed-9201-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'The third level', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/432101-venture-intellivision-the-third-level.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/0bf7467c-ab6d-11ed-aaf5-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Title Screen.', 'height': 256, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16440401-venture-arcade-title-screen.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9d620c2c-c21b-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4665867-venture-colecovision-front-cover.jpg	['ColecoVision']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/0f3f413c-abbc-11ed-9b12-02420a00019d.webp	587
Warlords	Working title: Kings in the Corner break-out game	<p>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it through and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it and control the speed of the game.</p>	9143	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Top-down, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Gameplay: Paddle / Pong, Setting: Fantasy, Setting: Medieval	7.0	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9143/warlords/	31		Windows (2004), Atari 2600 (1981), Xbox 360 (2010-06-30), Arcade (1981-04)	[{'caption': 'And player two is ahead by a point...!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/1517381-warlords-atari-2600-and-player-two-is-ahead-by-a-point.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/cfa2b4b4-ab75-11ed-a5ec-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'A game in progress', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/411645-warlords-atari-2600-a-game-in-progress.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/e2ccb7d2-ab6c-11ed-87d1-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}, {'caption': 'Deflect the fireball.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16426490-warlords-arcade-deflect-the-fireball.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/ca234c20-c217-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Insert Coin.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16426493-warlords-arcade-insert-coin.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/ca3e84b8-c217-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Ready for War.', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16426496-warlords-arcade-ready-for-war.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/ca564d5a-c217-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 256}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/3894822-warlords-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/b3d080a8-ab9e-11ed-9d05-02420a000198.webp	585

Xenophobe	Tag-lined title: Xenophobe: Exterminate the Aliens	<p>Xenos. The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart. A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence. A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. </p> <p><em>Xenophobe</em> is a side-scrolling shooter with platform elements. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additional weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.</p>	8255	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Shooter, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	5.8	https://www.mobygames.com/game/8255/xenophobe/	53		Lynx (1990), Amiga (1989), NES (1988-12), Atari ST (1989), Commodore 64 (1989), Atari 2600 (1990), Atari 7800 (1989), ZX Spectrum (1989), Amstrad CPC (1989), Arcade (1987), Antstream (2021-04-20)	[{'caption': 'Mission begins', 'height': 240, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/368782-xenophobe-nes-mission-begins.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/8ce7316c-ab6c-11ed-b9d3-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 256}, {'caption': 'Coming face to face with a snotterpiller without your gun is very, very bad', 'height': 102, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/374617-xenophobe-lynx-coming-face-to-face-with-a-snotterpiller-without-.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/988462b0-ab6c-11ed-8e21-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'The most advanced form of alien can zap you with electricity or throw rocks at you', 'height': 102, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/374284-xenophobe-lynx-the-most-advanced-form-of-alien-can-zap-you-with-.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/97dfb38c-ab6c-11ed-8b6f-02420a00019c.webp', 'width': 160}, {'caption': 'A friendly robot', 'height': 400, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/16300069-xenophobe-amiga-a-friendly-robot.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/707acbf8-c1ef-11ed-ab6b-02420a000194.webp', 'width': 640}, {'caption': 'Arriving at the first infested station', 'height': 102, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/374492-xenophobe-lynx-arriving-at-the-first-infested-station.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/9846c6da-ab6c-11ed-8e21-02420a00019b.webp', 'width': 160}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/4066372-xenophobe-nes-front-cover.jpg	['NES']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/a62c2ece-aba4-11ed-b951-02420a000197.webp	564
Yars' Revenge	Brazilian title: A Vingança dos Yars, working title: Time Freeze, Full GBC title: Yars' Revenge: the Qotile Ultimatum	<p>In <em>Yars' Revenge</em>, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile cannot be destroyed, however, you can temporarily hide from it in a shield that runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles' second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</p>	9396	Basic Genres: Action, Perspective: Side view, Visual Presentation: Fixed / flip-screen, Gameplay: Arcade, Setting: Sci-fi / futuristic	7.6	https://www.mobygames.com/game/9396/yars-revenge/	57		Windows (2010-03-24), Game Boy Color (1999-09), Atari 2600 (1981), Xbox 360 (2010-03-24), Browser (2010-08-13), Antstream (2020-07-08)	[{'caption': 'Main Menu (code for the current level will be there)', 'height': 576, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10474997-yars-revenge-game-boy-color-main-menu-code-for-the-current-level.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/77307bf4-ac10-11ed-b075-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 720}, {'caption': 'Watch out for the swirl from the Qotile', 'height': 576, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10475003-yars-revenge-game-boy-color-watch-out-for-the-swirl-from-the-qot.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/77ae8abc-ac10-11ed-b075-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 720}, {'caption': 'Main Title', 'height': 576, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10474994-yars-revenge-game-boy-color-main-title.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/76f45868-ac10-11ed-b075-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 720}, {'caption': 'To reach the enemy, you must breach the shield and avoid the seeker-missile', 'height': 576, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/10475006-yars-revenge-game-boy-color-to-reach-the-enemy-you-must-breach-t.jpg', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/77ebd7f0-ac10-11ed-b075-02420a00012f.webp', 'width': 720}, {'caption': 'Mission accomplished!', 'height': 200, 'image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/screenshots/328316-yars-revenge-atari-2600-mission-accomplished.png', 'thumbnail_image': 'https://cdn.mobygames.com/3be46dac-ab6c-11ed-be6f-02420a000197.webp', 'width': 320}]	800	https://cdn.mobygames.com/covers/6073788-yars-revenge-atari-2600-front-cover.png	['Atari 2600']	https://cdn.mobygames.com/a25985fc-abeb-11ed-8949-02420a00012e.webp	586
